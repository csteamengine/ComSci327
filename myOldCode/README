So far the assignment is incomplete. Monsters generate randomly and have attributes, but they dont all move.
currently a maximum of 3 monsters move when the funtion is called and I don't know what might be causing that.
Code will run if you use only 2 monsters.

to run the program, type make and then

./rlg327

switches include
--nummon <int num monsters>
--save
--save <filename>
--load <filename>
