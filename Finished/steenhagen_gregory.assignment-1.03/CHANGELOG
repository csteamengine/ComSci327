CHANGELOG Assignment 1.03

Day 1: Tuesday 2/2/2016
	Just finished assign1.02 and have been going through my code making it look better and work better.
	I got the iterations to work correctly and to correctly render the rooms.
	Getting ready to start Path Finding algorithm although I am not looking forward to it.

	Also added rm -f dungeonGen.c~ to my make clean because for some reason it kept generating those.

Day 2: Wednesday 2/3/2016
	Need to decide if I want to sort the rooms before cutting the corridors or not. When I sort them, only one 	corridor connects
	each room, but they often have turns or corners in them. However, when I don't sort them first, there isn'	t very many corners,
	but there are a lot more corridors.

	Working on cleaning up my working code before I start adding to it. Otherwise it'll just become a huge mes		s.

Day 3: Friday 2/5/2016
	Seperating the files and using header files. I got the program to run correctly using rlg327 and
	dungeonGen.c/h. It works pretty well and is a lot cleaner.

	Still going through my code to make it prettier, but looks a lot better with the files seperated.

	Got player character to generate in random spots in a random room. It picks a random room, and a random
	location in that room to place the player. It does not get saved because I was worried that it would
	fail to work with other peoples saves. Starting to work on Dijkstra's algorithm now.

	Messing with binheap and how to implement it using a priority queue. Not sure what a Priority queue is
	or how it functions.

Day 4: Saturday 2/6/2016
	Still working on getting binheap to work. It is having trouble with binheap_node_t

Day 5: Sunday 2/7/2016
	Got binheap to work. Had to change the way binheap_node_t was defined in binheap.h. I don't know why I had to do this and everyone else didn't but oh well.
	Binheap works now so that is good. Still need to figure out what to do with a binheap.

Day 6: Monday 2/8/2016
	Working on implementation of binheap and Dijkstra's Algorithm. trying to study up on what Dijkstra's actually is doing. I know I need
	to check all the neighbors and stuff but not sure how to do it correctly.

	Also adding some extra features like character color.

Day 7: Tuesday 2/9/16
	Started adding the Dijkstra's algorithm in using the binheap. Having trouble getting it to add the right
	value. For some reason every time I add a point, it gets wiped and replaces it with 255. I tried storing the
	points in an array but that didn't work.

Day 8: Wednesday 2/10/16
	Got binheap to work and am successfully calculating distances, but I am not sure that my algorith is completely correct. It
	gets a valid value, but I don't know if it is accurate.

Day 9: Friday 2/12/16
	Still working on fixing Dijkstra's. something is wrong with the distance algorithm so it doesn't quite come out right.
Day 10 Monday 2/15/16
	Got the NonTunneling implementation complete. Had an array of binheap nodes that I stored pointers to the binheap. That way I can
	change values inside the binheap and call binheap_decrease_key to have it resort. It works well and now I need to complete the Tunneling monsters.
	Not feeling it right now.

Day 11 Tuesday 2/16/16 -- My sister's Birthday.
	Finished the Tunneling monsters distance map as well. Was really easy, I just did the same thing that I did for the NT monsters, and
	changed the compare method and a few other things. Now I just need to make sure everything is correct, clean my code, and finish the README.
