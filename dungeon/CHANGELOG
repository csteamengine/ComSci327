CHANGELOG Assignment 1.03

Day 1: Tuesday 2/2/2016
	Just finished assign1.02 and have been going through my code making it look better and work better.
	I got the iterations to work correctly and to correctly render the rooms.
	Getting ready to start Path Finding algorithm although I am not looking forward to it.

	Also added rm -f dungeonGen.c~ to my make clean because for some reason it kept generating those.

Day 2: Wednesday 2/3/2016
	Need to decide if I want to sort the rooms before cutting the corridors or not. When I sort them, only one 	corridor connects
	each room, but they often have turns or corners in them. However, when I don't sort them first, there isn'	t very many corners,
	but there are a lot more corridors.

	Working on cleaning up my working code before I start adding to it. Otherwise it'll just become a huge mes		s.

Day 3: Friday 2/5/2016
	Seperating the files and using header files. I got the program to run correctly using rlg327 and
	dungeonGen.c/h. It works pretty well and is a lot cleaner.

	Still going through my code to make it prettier, but looks a lot better with the files seperated.

	Got player character to generate in random spots in a random room. It picks a random room, and a random
	location in that room to place the player. It does not get saved because I was worried that it would
	fail to work with other peoples saves. Starting to work on Dijkstra's algorithm now.

	Messing with binheap and how to implement it using a priority queue. Not sure what a Priority queue is
	or how it functions.
