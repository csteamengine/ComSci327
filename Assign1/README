For this project, I started off by doing it in Java and had originally done it all with recursion. After reading through again, I fixed it to only use recursion to list the actual ratio. It lists the hyperbinary sequence iteratively. The recursive file that lists a ratio from a given input is named "recRational.c"
and the file that lists the hyperbinary sequence up to 100,000,000 numbers is called "hyperbinary.c".

Iterative List -- "hyperbinary.c"

Recursive -- "recRational.c"
