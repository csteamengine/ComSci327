Assignment 1.03 -- Path Finding

For this assignment, I implemented both the Tunneling and Non-Tunneling mosters with Dijkstra's algorithm and a priority queue.
The functions work correctly as far as I can tell. I stored pointers to each item in the binheap so that I could access them. I also
stored the distances in 2D arrays called NTDist[][] and TDist[][]. The main program is called rlg327.c and is compiled to rlg327
My distance calculation is done in the file called character.c. The grids are printed remotely from the main program with a call to
printDistanceMaps().

to run the program, make the files and run

./rlg327
